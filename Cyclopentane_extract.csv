Among their functions are anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or contraceptive activities. Nowadays, microbial transformation of steroid precursors is winning relevance opposite to the chemical synthesis, since it allows for decreasing time, expenses, and environmental pollution.

In contrast to the typical S(E) reaction occurring at the carbon atom, the nitrogen atom in AB serves as the reaction center for the S(E) reaction with the boron moiety as the leaving group when the MCl(2) approaches the AB. The S(E)2 backside reaction is favored as a trigger step for the dehydrogenation of AB by ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Sung Jin Pai, Sang Soo Han"," Computational Science Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul 136-791, Republic of Korea.

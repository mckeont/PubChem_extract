In the first step, a helical distortion is recognized, which leads to a strand opening at the lesion site. The second step involves the recognition of the type of chemical modification in the single-stranded region of DNA during the processing of the lesions by UvrABC. In the current work, by comparing the efficiencies of UvrABC incision of several types of different DNA adducts, we show that th",Biochemistry,"Yue Zou, Steven M Shell, Christopher D Utzat, Charlie Luo, Zhengguan Yang, Nicholas E Geacintov, Ashis K Basu"," Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, James H.

Reaction of Ir(CO)(dppe)I (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane)) with RI (R = CH(3) and CF(3)) results in formation of the Ir(III) precursors IrR(CO)(dppe)(I)(2) (R = CH(3) (1a) and CF(3) (1b)). Subsequent treatment with AgOTf (OTf = triflate) generates the bis(triflate) analogues IrR(CO)(dppe)(OTf)(2) (R = CH(3) (2a) and CF(3) (2b)), which undergo clean metathesis with NaBARF (BARF = B(3,5-(CF(3))(2)C(6)H(3))(4)(-)) in the presence",Inorganic chemistry,"Paul J Albietz, Brian P Cleary, Witold Paw, Richard Eisenberg"," Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627, USA.",2002 Apr;41(8):2095-108,10.1021/ic025506s

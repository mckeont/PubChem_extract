Relationship between lipophilicity of C6-10 hydrocarbon solvents and their ROS-inducing potency in rat cerebellar granule cells. Neurotoxicology 2002;23:701-9).

We describe a sensitive method for the quantification of two endogenous biomarkers of oxidative damage: meta-tyrosine (m-Tyr) and ortho-tyrosine (o-Tyr). The assay can be applied to direct analysis of free amino acids or protein-bound amino acids following hydrolysis. The assay involves derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl bromide and extraction into n-decane, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.",Analytical biochemistry,"B C Blount, M W Duncan"," Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Unit, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.",1997 Jan;244(2):270-6,10.1006/abio.1996.9900

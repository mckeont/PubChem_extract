The pattern and spectra of TP53 mutations often differ between cancer types, perhaps due to different etiological factors. The Hupki (human TP53 knock-in) mouse embryo fibroblast (HUF) immortalization assay is useful for studying mutagenesis in the human TP53 gene by environmental carcinogens. Prior to initiating an immortalization assay, carcinogen treatment conditions must be optimized, which can require a large number of cells.

It is essentially unknown to which extent this source contributes to the total load of these chemicals in humans. One possible approach to the problem is to find suitable biomarkers. To this end five polycyclic mononitroarenes (nitro-PAH) were selected and methods developed to determine the sulfinic acid-type hemoglobin adducts they form in vivo.

The neonatal model is known to be very sensitive for the detection of carcinogens that operate via a genotoxic mode of action. In contrast, it is known not to respond to chemicals that act via epigenetic mechanisms, commonly observed in the two-year carcinogenicity studies. As such, the model has a high sensitivity and specificity in its response.

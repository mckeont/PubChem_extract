The present method provides a high-yielding entry to dialkyl cycloalkanones that cannot be accessed via direct alkylation of 2-methylcyclohexane-1,3-dione. The title reaction may be useful in the scalable preparation of terpene and steroidal building blocks in the arena of natural product synthesis.

The aim of this study was to examine the toxicity of thinner, xylene, and toluene on adult red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), as well as the effects of thinner and toluene on gene expression. The major compounds identified in the thinner with peak area >2% were p-xylene (6%), toluene (4%), 2,4-dimethylheptane (3%), methylcyclohexane (2.75%), 2-methylheptane (2%), cyclohexanone (2.6%), and nonane (2.1%).

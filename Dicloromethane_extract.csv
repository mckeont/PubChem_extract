Severe lung inflammation can reportedly induce coagulatory abnormalities and systemic inflammation. This study examined the effects of components of DEP on lung inflammation, pulmonary permeability, coagulatory changes, systemic inflammatory response, and lung-to-systemic translocation of LPS in a murine model of lung inflammation.

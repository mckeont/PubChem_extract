In human cells, telomerase activity is tightly regulated by the expression of its catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In most normal human somatic cells, hTERT is not expressed, and its suppression acts as an important gatekeeper against tumorigenesis.

Two categories of refractory celiac disease can be distinguished by the phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes and the status of TRG genes.

The protein methyl transferases are genetically altered in various human cancers. The enzymes that remove histone methylation have led to increased awareness of protein interactions as potential drug targets. Specifically, Lysine Specific Demethylases (LSD) removes methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) through formaldehyde-generating oxidation.

To date, only one kind of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)-dependent aldolases has been discovered and applied to synthesize branched-chain sugars directly using DHAP and dihydroxyacetone (DHA) as substrate. However, the unstable and high-cost properties of DHAP limit large-scale application.

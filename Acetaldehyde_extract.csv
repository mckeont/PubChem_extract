Here, we found higher serum levels of hexosylceramide (HexCer) d18:1/16:0 in patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and geographic atrophy (GA), two manifestations of late stage AMD, and higher ceramide (Cer) d18:1/16:0 levels in GA patients.

ALD can progress from alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), which is characterized by hepatic inflammation. Chronic ASH can eventually lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis and in some cases hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In addition, severe ASH (with or without cirrhosis) can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, which is an acute clinical presentation of ALD that is associated with liver failure and high m",Nature reviews.

An abundance of acetaldehyde is produced by excessive alcohol consumption and accumulates in the body to induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation in neuronal cells, which results in learning and cognitive decline. In the present study, C57BL/N mice were orally administered alcohol (16%) and Carthamus tinctorius L. seed (CTS) (100 and 200 mg/kg/day).

Previously, we have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcohol metabolites induce massive apoptosis in hepatocytes and the spread of HCV-infection to the neighboring uninfected cells. Here, we hypothesize that the capturing of AB by non-parenchymal cells, macrophages and hepatic",Biomolecules,"Murali Ganesan, Larisa Y Poluektova, Chijioke Enweluzo, Kusum K Kharbanda, Natalia A Osna"," Research Service, Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha, NE 68105, USA. murali.ganesan@unmc.edu.

In addition, GSH serves as a cofactor for the GSH peroxidase family of enzymes which metabolize H(2)O(2) as well as lipid peroxides.

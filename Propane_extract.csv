However, autophagy can also be a double-edge sword during certain bacterial infections (such as urinary tract infections) and in cancer, where it can be hijacked by the pathogens and cancer cells, respectively, to promote their own survival. Thus, autophagy modulation can potentially have multiple effects in multiple con",Cell death & disease,"Giulia Allavena, Doriana Debellis, Roberto Marotta, Chetanchandra S Joshi, Indira U Mysorekar, Benedetto Grimaldi"," Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, via Morego 30, 16163, Genova, Italy.

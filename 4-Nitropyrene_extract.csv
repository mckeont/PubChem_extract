However, the secondary combustion of diesel soot and associated compounds may also induce the formation of new pollutants. Diesel soot is rated as carcinogenic to humans and also acts as a carrier for a variety of genotoxic compounds such as certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or nitrated PAHs (nitro-PAHs). Furthermore, diesel exhaust contains considerable amounts of nitric oxide (NO), which can be converted",Environmental science & technology,"Norbert V Heeb, Peter Schmid, Martin Kohler, Erika Gujer, Markus Zennegg, Daniela Wenger, Adrian Wichser, Andrea Ulrich, Urs Gfeller, Peter Honegger, Kerstin Zeyer, Lukas Emmenegger, Jean-Luc Petermann, Jan Czerwinski, Thomas Mosimann, Markus Kasper, Andreas Mayer"," Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research, Laboratory for Solid State Chemistry and Catalysis, Uberlandstrasse 129, CH-8600 Dübendorf, Switzerland. norbert.heeb@empa.ch",2008 May;42(10):3773-9,10.1021/es7026949

We used lymphocyte sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency as a parameter to investigate the genotoxicity of low level EDC and VCM in VCM-manufacturing workers. The SCE frequency was determined for 51 male workers with exposure to VCM and/or EDC and for 20 male workers devoid of such exposure.

Several lines of evidence indicate that this interaction is dependent on glutathione depression and increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations produced by alpha1-adrenergic compounds. In this report, evidence is provided in support of the mechanism of adrenoreceptor-mediated potentiation of nephrotoxicity.

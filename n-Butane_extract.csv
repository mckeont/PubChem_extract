Remmer and associates confirmed the former view that ethane and n-pentane were derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, and they demonstrated that propane, n-butane and isobutane were released from amino acids.

11038587,19971028,article,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Electrophilic nitration of alkanes with nitronium hexafluorophosphate.,"Nitration of alkanes such as methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, neopentane, and cyclohexane was carried out with nitronium hexafluorophosphate in methylene chloride or nitroethane solution. Nitration of methane, albeit in poor yield, required protolytic activation of the nitronium ion. The results indicate direct electrophilic insertion of NO2+ into C-H and C-C final sigma-bonds.

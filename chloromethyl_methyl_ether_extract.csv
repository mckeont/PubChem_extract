The Methoxymethyl Cation as a Remarkably Selective Common Electrophile.,"Vacuum line kinetics studies have been made of the reaction in nitromethane between benzene and/or toluene, methoxyacetyl chloride (MAC), and AlCl(3) to produce benzyl or xylyl chlorides, CO, and a CH(3)OH(-)AlCl(3) complex. For both arenes, the rate law appears to be R = (k(3)/[AlCl(3)](0)) [AlCl(3)](2)[MAC]. When chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) is substituted for MAC, a similar rate law is obtained. Both chloromethylation reactions yielded similar, large k(T)()/k(B)() ratios (500-600) and similar product",The Journal of organic chemistry,"Franklin P. DeHaan, Markus Djaputra, Mark W.

The parameters studied were the inhibition of scheduled (duplicative) and unscheduled (reparative) DNA syntheses seen as tritiated thymidine uptake. The results obtained suggested that chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME), 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) gave positive results such as DNA damaging agents, while carbon tetrachloride (CTC), chlorofor",Cancer letters,"P Perocco, G Prodi",NULL,1981 Aug;13(3):213-8,10.1016/0304-3835(81)90020-3

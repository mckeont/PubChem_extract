The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory potential of single VOC and mixtures using an in vitro model. TNF-alpha stimulated human lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to VOC (1 ng/m3-100g/m3) via gas phase. After 20 h of exposure cytotoxicity and the release of the pro-inflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), I",Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,"G Fischäder, C Röder-Stolinski, G Wichmann, K Nieber, I Lehmann"," Department of Environmental Immunology, UFZ - Helmholtz Centre of Environmental Research, Permoserstrasse 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany.",2008 Mar;22(2):359-66,10.1016/j.tiv.2007.09.015

The diastereoselectivity of the reactions was high when the alkyl group R(2) was tertiary (tert-butyl), irrespective of the substituent X. Products were formed consistently with a diastereomeric ratio larger than 95:5 in favor of th",Journal of the American Chemical Society,"Dominik Nitsch, Stefan M Huber, Alexander Pöthig, Arjun Narayanan, George A Olah, G K Surya Prakash, Thorsten Bach"," Department Chemie and Catalysis Research Center (CRC), Technische Universität München , D-85747 Garching, Germany.",2014 Feb;136(7):2851-7,10.1021/ja411772n

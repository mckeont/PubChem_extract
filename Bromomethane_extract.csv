The reactions of benzyl chloride and trimethylsilyl chloride with iPr-LAB in THF were also studied. The amination of iodomethane is favored over reduction at low and room temperatures in pure THF and with increasing the amount of dioxane in THF. At higher temperatures, the reduction reaction a",The Journal of organic chemistry,"Lubov Pasumansky, Christopher J Collins, Lawrence M Pratt, Ngân Van Nguyên, B Ramachandran, Bakthan Singaram"," Department of Chemistry, University of California Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, California, USA.",2007 Feb;72(3):971-6,10.1021/jo062154o

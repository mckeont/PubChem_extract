The reactions of benzyl chloride and trimethylsilyl chloride with iPr-LAB in THF were also studied. The amination of iodomethane is favored over reduction at low and room temperatures in pure THF and with increasing the amount of dioxane in THF. At higher temperatures, the reduction reaction a",The Journal of organic chemistry,"Lubov Pasumansky, Christopher J Collins, Lawrence M Pratt, Ngân Van Nguyên, B Ramachandran, Bakthan Singaram"," Department of Chemistry, University of California Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, California, USA.",2007 Feb;72(3):971-6,10.1021/jo062154o

It is also the origin of the most common cancer in man, bronchogenic carcinoma. Rodent tracheal epithelial cells in culture can be used to study the genotoxic activity of airborne particulates leading to mutation and cancer. Airborne particulates were collected in the heavily industrialized Rhine-Ruhr region using a high volume sampler HVS 150 (Ströhlein Instruments) equipped with glass fibre filters.",Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,"C Hornberg, N H Seemayer"," Medical Institute of Environmental Hygiene at the Heinrich-Heine-University, Gurlittstrasse 53, D-40223 Düsseldorf, Germany.",1995 Aug;9(4):397-402,10.1016/0887-2333(95)00025-4

The precise nature of cation-anion binding is as yet poorly understood, and little is known of the extent of ionic interactions in the typically nonaqueous, low-polarity reaction media of most polymerizations. Nevertheless, adequate control of cation-anion interactions can greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of chemical processes and can provide low-energy alternatives to current methods.

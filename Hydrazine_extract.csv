(Env. Health Perspect. 124: 713, 2016) identified 10 key characteristics (KCs), one or more of which are commonly exhibited by established human carcinogens. The KCs reflect the properties of a cancer-causing agent, such as 'is genotoxic,' 'is immunosuppressive' or 'modulates receptor-mediated effects,' and are distinct from the hallmarks of cancer, which are the properties of tumors. To assess feasibility and limitations of applying the KCs to diverse agents, methods and results of mechanistic",Carcinogenesis,"Kathryn Z Guyton, Ivan Rusyn, Weihsueh A Chiu, Denis E Corpet, Martin van den Berg, Matthew K Ross, David C Christiani, Frederick A Beland, Martyn T Smith"," Monographs Programme, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have some side effects, mainly gastric irritation and gastric ulceration during the treatment of inflammation. So the current study deals with the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a series of novel pyrazole derivatives as anti-inflammatory agents.

Importantly, this methodology works with both α-branched and unbranched ketones for the construction of tri- and tetrasubstituted N-containing stereocenters. The reaction can be run at gram-scale with low catalyst loadings and features a recoverable and reusable ligand.

They can be roughly classified into NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent and NOX2-independent reagents. NOX2 activation is triggered by protein kinase C agonists (e.g., phorbol esters, transition metal ions), redox mediators (e.g., paraquat) or formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonists (e.g., aromatic hydrazine derivatives).

However, there is little information on the precise mechanisms about dentin bonding agent-induced pulpal inflammation. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme believed to be responsible for prostaglandin synthesis at the site of inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dentin bonding agents on the expression of COX-2 in human pulp cells.

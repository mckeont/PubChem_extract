Neither unleaded gasoline, at its maximum tolerated concentration in the medium, nor 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, at its limit of solubility, induced mutation at the thymidine kinase locus. Negative results were seen both in the presence and absence of a rat liver homogenate metabolizing system.

Experimental evidence suggests that these droplets contain alpha 2u-globulin, a low-molecular-weight protein found specifically in the urine of male rats. It has been proposed that aldehyde metabolites of TMP form Schiff base adducts with the lysine groups of alpha 2u-globulin and thereby inhibit renal lysosomal processing of the protein.

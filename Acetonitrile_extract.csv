We report herein an aza-reagent-free procedure using flavin catalyst (3-methyl riboflavin tetraacetate), triphenylphosphine, and visible light (448 nm), which allows effective esterification of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids with alcohols.

There are several factors enabling the cells to survive harsh environmental conditions. One aspect is the pigmentation, the melanin black yeasts often display a highly diverse carotenoid spectrum. Determination and characterization of carotenoids depend on an efficient extraction and separation, especially for black yeast, which is characterized by thick cell walls.

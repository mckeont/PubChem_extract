Participation of CHCl3 solvent molecules in the ionic process.,"The fluorination reaction of methane and isobutane by molecular F(2) with and without CHCl(3) solvent was studied with the ab initio and ONIOM theoretical calculations. The electrophilic pathway for the RH + F(2) reaction in general is a two-step process, consisting of hydride abstraction leading to an intermediate of the type R(+)(delta)...HF...F(-)(delta), followed by complicated rearrangement to give the electrophilic substitution product, RF + HF.

For this reason, the authors have adapted gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC/NICI-MS) (developed by Ramesha and Pickett in 1985) by employing an SPB-1 column and isobutane as the reagent gas.
